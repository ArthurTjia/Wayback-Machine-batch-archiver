# Wayback-Machine-batch-archiver
# I made this little script as a way to make it easier to save Japanese web novels to the Internet Archive.
# Instead of feeding each individual page to the Internet Archive, I figured that it would be easier to do it in batches.
# The script opens up in your web browser and you will need to allow the page to open up additional windows.
# Those additional windows are actually telling the Wayback Machine to read the target page and save it.
# The downside is that the Wayback Machine will not save the target page(s) unless it can feed the saved page(s) back to your browser, hence the new windows.
# I intend to make a Python script to see if I can get the Wayback Machine to save the page(s) without having to wait for it to load any page in my browser.
